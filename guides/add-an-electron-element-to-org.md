# Moving a repo into org

This guide is for moving a repo in to this org, if you have a electron-element
and want to move it into this org. Before we get started thanks for taking your time
and creating an electron-element we greatly appreciate it.

If you have any question regarding this process please open an issue in this repo.

## Criteria before moving an electron-element to this repo.

  <!-- TODO: Make a team @electron-elements/helpers that will help whoever needs help -->
  - Your electron element must be working, if its work in progress and just need a little bit of
  tweaks or help that we could provide from our side you can go ahead continue with the process.

  - It should have a valid open source license.

  - It should have docs, if you have a little bit of docs and think that you can work on docs once this is moved into org you can go ahead and continue with the process. We will decide what do with this while
  moving this into the repo

  - It should be a relevant custom element that works with the electron.

## Next steps

If you think you match all the criteria above great move on with this guide. If you think you don't
match the criteria but your repo is worth moving into org open up an issue and we will take it from there.

Next step is to open up an issue with following details:

  - The title of the issue should be `add a new electron-element: <name-of-your-electron-element>`
  - The body should include the link of the current repo of this element, little description about this element

And done, you did all the work, and steps needed to move this repo into org, we will follow up with other details
in the issue you opened. Feel free to read through the end to get details about how tp publish your npm package into electron-elements
npm org (NPM Guide is still not done).

## Publishing and maintaining npm package of your element

Yet to be written, will be done once the first repo is moved in!
Keep basic steps in mind, you will be added to npm's `@electron-elements` org after you provide your npm username.

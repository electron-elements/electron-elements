# electron-elements

electron-elements is created to have set of custom elements to be used in
an electron app. The main benefits of custom elements inside a electron app
is that they don't need to be polyfilled or need to handle cross browser problems,
thus making creating and maintaing them easier. And with the great collections of 
electron-elements we hope to provide everyone, creating an electron app easier
way to implement some functionality that's customizable and easy to use.
